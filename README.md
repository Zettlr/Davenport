> Open Source Text Management and Collaborative Writing for the 21st Century

This project offers an intuitive, self-hosted Open Source writing tool, which addresses the growing need for collaborative work. It builds upon already existing tools such as [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr) and [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) to productively make use of a lot of paradigms and best-practices in collaborative work and combine this with existing workflows in University institutes.

This project is led by Albert Krewinkel (pandoc project) and Hendrik Erz (Zettlr).

Among the features will be:

- GDPR-compliant self-hosting
- Free of Charge
- Aimed at researchers with few or no technical knowledge
- Intuitive and immersive
- Manages data, references, texts, notes, and Zettelkästen
